# Go Backend Project

## Overview
This project is a backend application written in Go (Golang). It provides a set of RESTful APIs for managing and processing data. The application is designed to be fast, reliable, and scalable, making use of Go's powerful concurrency model and robust standard library.

## Features
- RESTful API endpoints
- JSON-based request and response handling
- Database integration (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling
- Configuration management
- Unit and integration testing
- Docker support for containerization
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.18+ installed on your machine
- Docker (for containerization)
- Make (for using Makefile commands)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL database

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    cd yourproject
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod download
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your environment-specific variables:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
    PORT=8080
    ```

### Running the Application
To start the application locally:
1. Ensure your database is running and accessible.
2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running with Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
    ```sh
    docker build -t yourproject .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:
    ```sh
    docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env yourproject
    ```

### Testing
To run the tests:
```sh
go test ./...
```
